    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "a. The issue with K nearest neighbors: We are working with a very sparse and wide feature set. This means the curse of dimensionality is very real and something that must be considered when choosing a model. The Knn model is directly dependent on the feature(s) nearest (does not make any assumptions whatsoever). So modeling a sparse feature set with the knn model will likely have difficulty matching non-zero features.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. The number of training examples we are working with is only slightly more than 2000. Using a smaller amount of training examples such as this, Logistic Regression is more likely to overfit the training set. Naive Bayes does better because it models the whole joint distribution, helping to avoid overfitting on a smaller training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. For each value of C, each increasing by a factor of 10, we find that the sum of squared weight values increases by at least two times. The increase being most dramatic increasing from the smallest C values.  "

Although not surprising, I find that this feature is a great example of how effective the weights can be in identifying important features for each class. However, the bigram features in general do not seem to be performing as well as the word features after comparing the two tables. This is particularly evident in the final class of the table, talk.religion.misc, where the \"hy\" top weighted feature is almost weighted as strong in the sci.space class. "

The preprocessing function runs on the raw text, before it is split into words by the tokenizer. Your preprocessor should try to normalize the input in various ways to improve generalization. For example, try lowercasing everything, replacing sequences of numbers with a single token, removing various other non-letter characters, and shortening long words. If you're not already familiar with regular expressions for manipulating strings, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html, and re.sub() in particular.

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",

    "ANSWER: The \"tfidf\" in TfidVectorizer stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency. This is a statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is in a document of a collection. It helps adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general, as opposed to the straight term count that the countVectorizer employs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is unable to appropriately weight documents that are very short. Not only were the weights predicting the wrong label on the short documents (example 1 and 2 above), they were predicting the weights incorectly by a very large margin. The 3rd example mistake the model made was due to the nature of the documents features. Although the document was labeled as religon.misc, the model predicted the comp.graphics and with very good intentions. The document is largely discussing the technical details of how to print out a book.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3rd mistake would be difficult to avoid as the documents features were not representative of the rest of the labels corpus. However, the 1st and 2nd mistakes on the small documents could at least be minimized. One technique for doing so would be to adjust the weights features are given against the total number of terms in the document. Also, a larger training set of data would help avoid overfitting, which is exactly what I believe happened in this case. A smaller document may only match a couple features on a smaller training data set such as the one we used.  "
